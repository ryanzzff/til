# shadowsocks vs. VPN

## shadowsocks

An open-sourced socks5-based proxy. It focuses on circumventing traffic restrictions \(e.g. gorvernment censorship\).

* The packages in Shadowsocks are unencrypted
* It works with multiple TCP connections to have faster speeds
* It doesn't send all the traffic through a server
* It is very difficult to detect and block as it masking the traffic to make it appear as HTTPS

## Virtual Private Network \(VPN\)

* It is designed for privacy and anonymity.
* VPN encrypts all network traffic as long as it is enabled.
